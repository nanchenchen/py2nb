PY2NB
=====

Overview
________

PY2NB is a small utility for turning python scripts into Jupyter notebooks and
convert module-level multi-line (triple quoted) string literals into Markdown
cells. It also converts the specialized comment strings (i.e., ``#%%``) that
`Don Jayamanne's Jupyter Extension <https://github.com/DonJayamanne/vscodeJupyter>`_
for `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ interprets
as cell breaks/divisions into cell breaks in the returned notebook.
